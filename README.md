# Bikes Prediction at any given station
The project is about predicting the city bicycles availability at the docking stations at any given hour. 
For this model the 3 datasets are provided, the job is to do ETL and data understanding and apply machine learning model to predict number of bikes at any given station at any given time. 

The aim of the project is to keep minimum number of bikes available at all times at any given station.

When the total number of bikes are less in any given station the model notifies the bike fillers.
